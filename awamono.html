Since then I've worked as a web developer and designer for 6 months, then studied at Vancouver Film School for a year and now I do freelance work. I'm excited to expand on my web development knowledge and to build really cool experiences for people. My current hobby is to become a formidable Tekken 7 fighter (I no longer wish to just smash the buttons).</p>");
