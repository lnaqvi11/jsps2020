    Hello everyone,

<p>I am Jaydeep Patel from Ahmedabad city Located in Gujarat, India. I have completed Bachelors of Science in IT in 2019. Afterwards, I also did 2 months internship in web development and that's where this field attracted me and decided to join this course.</p>

<p>Besides this, I am also a digital marketer by passion and also did one and a half months of training in it and read a lot in it. Talking about my hobbies, I love to learn and explore new things, also I love to travel a lot. I am also. a huge movie buff, and have watched almost half of the Hollywood (exaggerating :P) , but I like drama and thriller movies more. </p>

Thank you.
